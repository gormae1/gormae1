- 👋 Hello / Bonjour / 你好 / こんにちは, I’m Elliot!
- 🏫 I'm in my fourth year of Computer Science at McMaster University.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience with embedded systems and robotics to better support the parts of society we all rely on — that includes transportation, healthcare, education, and everything in between!
<!---
- . Low level languages (such as C/C++) are my primary focus, though I am experienced with higher level languages (such as Java, Python, and Javascript).
