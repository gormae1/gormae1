- 👋 Hello / Bonjour / 你好 / こんにちは, I’m Elliot Gorman!
- 🏫 I'm in my third year of Computer Science at McMaster University
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience with embedded systems, firmware development, quality assurance (QA), and robotics. Low level languages (such as C/C++) are my primary focus, though I am experienced with higher level languages (such as Java, Python, and Javascript). I hope to develop a career from advancing technology to better support the parts of society we all rely on — that includes education, transportation, healthcare, and everything in between!
- 📫 You can reach me via email at egreach(at)outlook(dot)com
