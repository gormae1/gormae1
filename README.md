- 👋 Hi, I’m Elliot Gorman
- 🏫 I'm in my third year of Computer Science at McMaster University
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience with embedded systems, firmware development, and robotics. Low level languages (such as C/C++) are my primary focus, and I hope to develop a career from advancing technology to better support the societies we live — that includes transportation, healthcare, and everything in between!
- 📫 You can reach me via email at egreach(at)outlook(dot)com
